## ðŸŽ“ Education
### University of California, Santa Barbara
#### B.S. Computer Engineering 

College of Engineering Honors Program

GPA: `3.89`

*Sept. 2019 - Jun. 2023*

## ðŸ’¼ Work Experience
### PayPal
#### Software Engineering Intern

- Designed and implemented a microservice API in Java Spring that provides users with finer control over their account's capabilities, e.g. payment types accepted by a merchant.
- Documented UML class diagrams, sequence flow diagrams, and API specs on Swagger to collaborate with clients.
- Competed in a 48-hour hackathon with 3 teammates leading to inter-organization recognition for the project and senior leadershipâ€™s encouragement to apply for a patent internally.

*Jun. 2022 - Sept. 2022 ~ San Jose, CA*

### National Ignition Facility, Lawrence Livermore National Lab
#### Systems Engineering Intern

- Applied systems engineering principles to select and deploy a ~$100k-$200k software system that collects, stores, and analyzes data from optics fabrication & recycling machines for NIF.
- Interviewed 30 stakeholders of engineers, managers, technicians, and cybersecurity experts to collect requirements.
- Developed system requirements, architectures, and a concept of operations (CONOPs) to capture the deployment configuration and end-user experience.

*Jun. 2021 - Jun. 2022 ~ Livermore, CA*

#### Software Intern

- Designed a schema for a SQL database to replace the legacy Excel-based data management system.
- Prototyped a GUI and REST API with Python to automate managing data, performing computations, and generating formatted spreadsheets.
- Kicked off development for a production web application with a Java Spring REST API and front-end to add the application to the lab-wide internal web app suite, improving client-side accessibility.
- Developed Splunk dashboards to use probabilistic methods to identify and highlight outliers in data.

*Jun. 2020 - Jun. 2021 ~ Livermore, CA*

## ðŸ”­ Research & Projects
### DataDriven [ðŸ”—](https://about.datadrivenucsb.com/)
#### Software Engineer & PCB Designer (Team Lead)

- Developed microcontroller firmware based on Zephyr RTOS to interface with peripherals that collects vehicle diagnostic data, fetches GPS data, and uploads the marshalled UDP datagram over LTE-M.
- Designed the PCB layout for a 4-layer custom PCB including on-board RF circuitry (LTE-M & GPS).
